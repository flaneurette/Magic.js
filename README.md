# Magic.js

<img src="https://github.com/flaneurette/Magic.js/blob/main/assets/images/magic-js-logo.png" />

A minimal JavaScript framework, similar to VUE.js, React and other frameworks, but much easier to work with. Magic.js is unique as it seperates data loading and DOM manipulation from other JavaScript logic, making it much quicker to learn and easier to implement. 

Currently under development.
